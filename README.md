##User Manual

1. Running the program will automatically download bip39.txt and rpc.txt, and then create 88.txt

When an ETH address with a balance greater than 0 is found, the ETH address, private key, and mnemonic words will be saved to 88.txt

RPC in rpc.txt can be added by oneself. The more RPC nodes there are, the smoother the software's queries will be, avoiding using a single RPC that exceeds the daily limit of RPC
