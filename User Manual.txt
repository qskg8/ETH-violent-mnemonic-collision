##  User Manual
Step 1:

Run the program. It will automatically download bip39.txt and rpc.txt, and create 88.txt file.

Step 2:

When an Ethereum address with a balance greater than 0 ETH is found, the Ethereum address, private key, and mnemonic will be saved to the 88.txt file.

Step 3:

You can add more RPC nodes to the rpc.txt file. The more RPC nodes there are, the smoother the program will run and avoid hitting the daily limit of a single RPC node.
